# Notes

## How to get network id
This is place to manually add network configure: https://accounts.gcp.databricks.com/cloud-resources/network/network-configurations/

for the step 3 on this doco: https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/gcp/customer-managed-vpc.html#network-requirements-1

Once created, click on the name of VPC network and you can get the `network_id` at the end of the URL. For example, the `network_id` is `584f59d3-b43c-49b5-9a28-84765fb0f905` in this URL: https://accounts.gcp.databricks.com/cloud-resources/network/network-configurations/584f59d3-b43c-49b5-9a28-84765fb0f905
